Congratulations and welcome to IEEE at UCSD! If you are here, that means you have gotten an email from the current President referring you to this site!

## Before we get started...

There are a few things you need to know:

-   No credentials will be given out in this document
-   You should have received access to the information already (either by email or DM). If you haven't, please inform your respective commanding officer for proper access.
-   If you are a new officer, you **MUST** go through the entire website. There are categories that will be split up by the different officer positions. If so, then go to the respective tab.

## Time to get started

Navigate to the left sidebar to where it says Getting Started. Expand it if you haven't already and click the topmost tab. The right sidebar is there to help you navigate the page you are currently on.
