In IEEE, we need your contact info in case we need to get in touch with you or need to provide information with others at IEEE or other organizations.

## Joining the spreadsheet

On the welcome email, you should have gotten a link that redirects you to a google spreadsheet. On that spreadsheet, you will find a list of different officer positions. Make sure you fill out the information for your position. Do not delete or modify any other information.

:::caution
Keep in mind that the President may ask for different types of information, such as your name, email, phone number, and an IEEE membership number (which you can find on the next tab). This will vary and if any additional information is needed, ask your respective executive officers for help!

## Now what?

Once you are done filling out the information, you can close the spreadsheet and send an email back to the president telling them that you are done. They will let you know if there are any additional steps that you have to take or any information that they might need.
