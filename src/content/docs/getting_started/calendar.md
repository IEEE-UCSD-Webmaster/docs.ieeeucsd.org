We have multiple calendars, but the two main ones are the `internal` calendar and the `events` calendar.

## Adding the calendars

To be able to have read and write access to the calendars, you will need to be invited to our google group. You should have gotten an invite (from google) to access it.

### Internal Calendar

The internal calendar is used to keep track of all the events that are happening in the club. This includes the private meetings as well as the planned public events / workshops. This should not be shared with anyone.

### Events calendar

The events calendar is public and can actually be view on our website (https://ieeeucsd.org/events). This is a calendar where most of our, you guessed it, events are posted. This is not limited to official events, but social events and workshops as well.
