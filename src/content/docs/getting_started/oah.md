Open Access Hours, also referred to as OAH, is where you provide access to the Project Space for members. This is how non-officers get access to the project space so they can relax/work on homework/projects.

## Project Space

The area you will be hosting your Open Access Hours in is the Project Space. This is on the fourth floor of the Jacobs School of Engineering Building (EBU1-4710). Project Space is an area where we provide members access to different tools and resources to help them with their projects. This area is also where some meetings may happen too.

### Code for Project Space

An email or DM should have been sent to you in regards to your code for the Jacobs building as well as Project Space. If you have not received this email, please contact the **Project Space Chair** to get your code.

:::danger[Important]
Do NOT share this code with anyone. This include past officers, current officers, and other members. Each person should have their own code if they are allowed to access project space. Failure to abide by this will result in a warning. Repeated violations will result in a suspension.

### Knowing where everything is

It would definitely be helpful if you knew where everything is. While there is no definite list, you should at least be aware of the general areas of the project space and the different items we may have.

### Project Space Rules

Please make sure to follow as well as enforce the rules for the members within Project Space. Once again, each year is different, so please consult with the **Project Space Chair** to see what rules we have.

## Scheduling your OAH

Every officer is required to host at least 2 hours of open access hours every week. This is to ensure that members have access to the project space at any given time.

You should have gotten an email inviting you to the `Open Access Hours Calendar`. While this calendar is public, you should be able to have edit access to it. You may freely choose what time your OAH will be at, however, the president may ask you to change it if there is too much of a time conflict (or if theres too many people at a certain time slot).

## What to do during OAH

You can do whatever you want during OAH as long as your respectful and considerate of others. Some people may be studying or working on homework, so as long as you're being mindful, you should be fine

### Officer Presence

Depending on the Project Space Chair's discretion, you may be required to be set up a Presence detector in project space. This is to ensure that you are actually attending your Open Access Hours. Please consult with the Project Space Chair as to how you can set this up.

### Providing items to the members

Each year is different. Please consult with the **Project Space Chair** to see what items we have available and can give away. Some items are reserved for teams, such as Robocup and Micromouse, so please double check first before giving it away.

### Storing items

Members who are not part of a team cannot store their items at Project Space without any prior approval. However, some exceptions may apply depending on who that person is and what they are affiliated with.

If an item is stored away, please do not touch, move, or mess with the item. Especially if it looks like a personal item that belongs with someone else.

### Missing your OAH

If you cannot make your open access hours, please delete only that weekâ€™s event from the calendar and send a message on the #openhours channel on Slack to see if anyone can cover you.
