IEEE@UCSD is a student branch of the IEEE and an organization at UCSD. Because this is an official Student Organization, every officer is required to be an IEEE member.

## How to join

This is fairly simple. Navigate to this link: https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/index.html and press the button that says "Join as a student". It will ask you to put an account and password. If you don't have an account, you can create one. If you already have an account, you can log in.

It will ask you to add a membership to your cart. You can choose to pay for a year or two years. If you are a student, you can get a student membership for around $32 dollars. When it asks you for your organization, you can put in "UC San Diego" or "UCSD".

:::caution
The price of the membership can change from when this was written. Even so, you must pay for the IEEE membership to be an officer (This applies to existing officers too!). You can try to use this discount code: "FUTURE50" for 50% off, though your results may vary.

Enter your billing information and you are done!

## IEEE Membership Number

You should have gotten your IEEE membership number (you should be able to view it in your account details or in an email). A google sheet should have been shared with you (it may be the contact info spreadsheet from the previous tab). Copy your IEEE membership number and paste it into the google sheet. If you do not have a place to paste it, you can email it to the President.
