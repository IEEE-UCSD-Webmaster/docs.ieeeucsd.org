You should have gotten an onboarding email to join slack. The slack invite link looks something like this: `***.slack.com/join/***`. Keep in mind that the slack invite link is only valid for a certain amount of time.

:::danger[Important]
Whatever you do, **DO NOT SHARE THE INVITE LINK**! That link is for you and only you.

## Creating an account

If you don't have a slack account, you must create one using your UCSD email address. Please be sure to fill out the following details:

-   First name
-   Last name
-   Email address
-   Phone number
-   Title
-   Picture of yourself

By filling this out, other officers know who you are and what your position is. Your respective executive officer will assign you to the appropriate channels to be a part of.

## Using Slack

### Tutorial

Slack has a unique way of navigating, as it can be very confusing at first. Please review the tutorial if it is your first time using Slack. You can also visit this website https://slack.com/resources#getting-started if you need any additional help.

### Notifications

You will need notifications on when joining slack and it is required for you to install it on your mobile device. This is a neccessity for everyone since we need to be able to easily contact you when we need help or information about something. Slack Desktop App is also nice to have, but it is not required.

After you download Slack, make sure to change these settings:

-   "Notify me about…" —> Select “All new messages"
-   Check the box labeled “Notify me about replies to threads I’m following"
-   Notification Schedule —> Every day, 00:00 to Midnight
-   “When I’m inactive on desktop” —> “Send notifications to my mobile devices” —> Select “as soon as I’m inactive"

### Channels

Slack is similar to discord, where they use "channels" to organize conversations. Those who have proper permissions can create channels while everyone else can only view them.

Each channel is used for a certain purpose. For example, the `#zplay` channel is used for general / off topic discussions. The `#announcements` channel is used for announcements.

You could also join the premade channels if it is public.

### Direct Messages

In slack, you can send direct messages to other officers. This is useful for asking questions or getting help. However, keep in mind that not all officers can respond to your DM right away and that you should still talk to them with respect in mind (espeically if you don't know them at all).
