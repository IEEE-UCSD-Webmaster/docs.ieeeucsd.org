Congrats on finishing this segment. Next, you'll need to go to the officer tab and choose your position. You do not need to read any other positions, but you are welcome to.

Keep in mind that this onboarding site may not have everything that you need. Any sensitive information has been kept out and the other details would have been given to you by the previous officer who had your position!
